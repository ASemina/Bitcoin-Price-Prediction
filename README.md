For this project I tried to evluate Bitcoin fluctuations using pattern matching on price trends.
For the patterns, I normalized each consecuative 7 days of data to a set range and then calculate each individual day's euclidean distance from the week I want to predict after.
I plan to expand this project to use Machine Learning models and use this as a baseline.
